# SwimFit App - Integration Context

## Project Overview
This project involves integrating functionality from the Crach-scan client management system into the SwimFit app. The goal is to enhance the SwimFit app with database integration (Google Sheets), QR code scanning, and a complete client management system.

## Original Codebases
- **SwimFit App**: A Next.js application for managing swim training sessions, clients, and scheduling
- **Crach-scan**: A client management system with QR code scanning and Google Sheets integration

## Integration Plan
1. Implement Google Sheets API integration for database functionality
2. Add client management capabilities with notes tracking
3. Implement attendance logging with detailed notes and readable spreadsheet records
4. Ensure client names are stored directly in spreadsheet for better readability
5. Add session history dialog to view attendance records for past sessions
6. Generate and store unique QR codes for each client to use for attendance tracking
7. Add QR code scanning capability with automatic camera access
8. Connect client management to the database backend
9. Implement session scheduling with database persistence
10. Ensure proper data flow between all components

## Architecture
- Frontend: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Database: Google Sheets API for serverless data storage
- Authentication: Custom session management
- Features: QR code scanning, client management, session scheduling

## Development Status
- Google Sheets API integration complete
- QR code generation and scanning implemented
  - Automatic QR code generation for each client upon creation
  - QR code storage in the Google Sheets database
  - Large, scannable QR codes displayed at the bottom of client profiles
  - Download functionality for printing client QR codes
- Client management connected to database
- Session scheduling with database persistence implemented
- Attendance tracking functionality fully integrated

## Attendance Tracking Features
- Real-time attendance logging via QR code scanning
- Manual check-in option for clients
- Session status tracking (upcoming, in progress, completed)
- Attendance history view with filterable results
- Client selection for quick check-ins
- Loading states and error handling for better UX

## Technical Implementation
- TypeScript interfaces for proper type checking
- API endpoints for attendance data management
- Integration with Google Sheets for data persistence
- Real-time data refresh for attendance status
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
