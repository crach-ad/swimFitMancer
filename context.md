# SwimFit App - Integration Context

## Project Overview
This project involves integrating functionality from the Crach-scan client management system into the SwimFit app, along with integrating the enhanced login UI from the swimfit-login project. The goal is to enhance the SwimFit app with a robust Firebase database integration, QR code scanning capabilities, a complete client management system with authentication, and a modern, responsive login experience with proper route protection.

## Original Codebases
- **SwimFit App**: A Next.js application for managing swim training sessions, clients, and scheduling
- **Crach-scan**: A client management system with QR code scanning and Google Sheets integration

## Integration Plan
1. Migrate from Google Sheets to Firebase Firestore for robust database functionality
2. Implement Firebase Authentication for secure user management
3. Add client management capabilities with notes tracking
4. Implement attendance logging with detailed notes and real-time database records
5. Build protected routes to ensure secure access to application features
6. Generate and store unique QR codes for each client to use for attendance tracking
7. Add QR code scanning capability with automatic camera access
8. Connect client management to the Firebase backend
9. Implement session scheduling with real-time database persistence
10. Ensure proper data flow and authentication throughout the application

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and synchronization
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with protected routes
- **Features**: QR code scanning, client management, session scheduling, user profiles
- **Security**: Firebase security rules to control data access

## Development Status
- Firebase integration complete
  - Firestore database set up for data storage
  - Session-specific attendance tracking implemented with nested collection paths
- API Routes updated for Vercel deployment
  - Fixed route handler signatures to use NextRequest type
  - Created alternate API route for package limit updates
  - Resolved dependency conflicts for production deployment
  - Downgraded React from v19 to v18 for compatibility with react-day-picker
  - Adjusted date-fns version to ensure compatibility with the component ecosystem
- UI Improvements
  - Simplified dashboard design with metrics section removed for cleaner interface
  - Minimalist login UI with SwimFit branding directly on homepage (no redirection needed)
  - Program highlights (Muscle Aerobics, Learn to Swim, Stroke Development) featured prominently
  - Clean, responsive design prioritizing simplicity and usability
  - Authentication system implemented with login/signup pages
  - Protected routes to secure application access
  - Firebase security rules implemented
  - Consistent navigation with Home button on all main pages for easy return to dashboard
  - Improved user flow between application sections with intuitive navigation patterns
- QR code generation and scanning implemented
  - Automatic QR code generation for each client upon creation
  - QR code storage in Firestore database
  - Large, scannable QR codes displayed at the bottom of client profiles
  - Download functionality for printing client QR codes
- Client management connected to Firebase database
- User profile management with authentication
- Session scheduling with real-time database persistence
- Attendance tracking functionality fully integrated

## Attendance Tracking Features
- Real-time attendance logging via QR code scanning
- Manual check-in option for clients
